How Do I Obtain the Security Certificate of CSS?
================================================

The security certificate (**CloudSearchService.cer**) can be downloaded only for security clusters that have enabled HTTPS access.

#. Log in to the CSS management console.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Clusters**. The cluster list is displayed.
#. Click the name of a cluster to go to the cluster details page.
#. On the **Configuration** page, click **Download Certificate** next to **Security Mode**.
