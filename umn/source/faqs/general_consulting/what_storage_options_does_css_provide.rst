What Storage Options Does CSS Provide?
======================================

CSS uses EVS and local disks to store your indices. During cluster creation, you can specify the EVS disk type and specifications (the EVS disk size).

-  Supported EVS disk types include common I/O, high I/O, and ultra-high I/O.
-  The EVS disk size varies depending on the node specifications selected when you create a cluster.
