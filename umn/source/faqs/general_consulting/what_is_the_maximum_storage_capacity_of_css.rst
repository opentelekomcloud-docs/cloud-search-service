What Is the Maximum Storage Capacity of CSS?
============================================

You can configure up to 200 nodes for a cluster (each node corresponds to an ECS). The maximum storage capacity of an ECS is the total capacity of EVS disks attached to the ECS. You can calculate the total storage capacity of CSS based on the sizes of EVS disks attached to different ECSs. The EVS disk size is determined by the node specifications selected when you create the cluster.
