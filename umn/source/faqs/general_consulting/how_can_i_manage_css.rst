How Can I Manage CSS?
=====================

You can use any of the following three methods to manage CSS or to use search engine APIs. You can initiate requests based on constructed request messages.

-  curl

   curl is a command-line tool used to transfer data to or from a given URL. It serves as an HTTP client that can send HTTP requests to the HTTP server and receive response messages. You can also use curl to debug APIs. For more information about curl, visit https://curl.haxx.se/.

-  Code

   You can call APIs through code to assemble, send, and process request messages.

-  REST client

   Both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome provide a graphical browser plugin, the REST client, which you can use to send and process requests.

   - For Mozilla Firefox, see `Firefox REST Client <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/>`__.

   - For Google Chrome, see `Postman <https://www.getpostman.com/>`__.
