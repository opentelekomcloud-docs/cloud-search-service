How Do I Reset the Administrator Password of a Security-mode Cluster in CSS?
============================================================================

If you want to change the administrator password of a security cluster or you have forgotten the password, reset the password.

#. On the **Clusters** page, locate the target cluster whose password you want to reset and click the cluster name. The **Cluster Information** page is displayed.
#. In the **Configuration** area, click **Reset** next to **Reset Password**. Set and confirm the new administrator password.

   .. note::

      -  The password can contain 8 to 32 characters.
      -  The password must contain at least three of the following character types: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The following special characters are allowed: ``~!@#$%^&*()-_=+\|[{}];:,<.>/?``
      -  Do not use the administrator name, or the administrator name spelled backwards, as the password.
      -  You are advised to change the password periodically.
