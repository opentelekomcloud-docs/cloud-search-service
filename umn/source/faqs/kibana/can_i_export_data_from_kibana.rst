Can I Export Data from Kibana?
==============================

Exporting data from Kibana requires the SQL Workbench plugin. Currently, you can only export data from Kibana 7.6.2 or later.

In SQL Workbench of Kibana, you can enter Elasticsearch SQL statements to query data or click **Download** to export data. You can export 1 to 200 data records. By default, 200 data records are exported.
