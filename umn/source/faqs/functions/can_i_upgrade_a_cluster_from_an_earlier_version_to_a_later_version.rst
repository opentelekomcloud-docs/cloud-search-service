Can I Upgrade a Cluster from an Earlier Version to a Later Version?
===================================================================

A cluster cannot be directly upgraded. You can purchase a cluster of a later version and migrate your data to it.

#. Creating a Cluster: Create a cluster of a later version in the region where your current cluster is deployed.
#. Migrating a Cluster: Migrate your cluster by backing data up and restoring indexes.
