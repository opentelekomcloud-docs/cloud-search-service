Deleting a Cluster
==================

You can delete clusters you no longer require. If you delete a cluster, snapshots created for the cluster will not be deleted and will be saved in the OBS bucket.

.. note::

   After you delete a cluster, its data cannot be restored. Exercise caution when deleting a cluster.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the CSS management console.
#. Click **Clusters** to switch to the **Clusters** page. In the row that contains the cluster you want to restart, click **More > Delete** in the **Operation** column.
#. In the displayed dialog box, enter the name of the cluster to be deleted and click **OK**.
