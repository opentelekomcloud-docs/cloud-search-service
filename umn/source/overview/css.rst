Cloud Search Service (CSS) is a fully managed, distributed search service that enables you to perform quick, real-time search. It is fully compatible with open-source Elasticsearch and provides users with structured and unstructured data search, statistical analysis, and reporting capabilities. CSS works in the way similar to a database.

You can easily deploy CSS and quickly create clusters. With optimal configurations, CSS is O&M-free. CSS provides you with key metrics regarding the system, clusters, and query performance, freeing you to focus on business logic.

For details about Elasticsearch, see the `Elasticsearch Reference <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html>`__.
