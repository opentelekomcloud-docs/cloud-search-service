Cloud Search Service (CSS) is a fully hosted distributed search service based on Elasticsearch. You can use it for structured and unstructured data search, and use AI vectors for combine search, statistics, and reports. CSS is a fully managed cloud service of the ELK Stack and is compatible with Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Cerebro.

Elasticsearch is a distributed search engine that can be deployed in standalone or cluster mode. The heart of the ELK Stack, Elasticsearch clusters support multi-condition search, statistical analysis, and create visualized reports of structured and unstructured text. For details about Elasticsearch, see the `Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html>`__.

CSS can be automatically deployed, allowing you to quickly create Elasticsearch clusters. It provides the search engine optimization practices and does not require your O&M. Additionally, it has a robust monitoring system to present you key metrics, including clusters and query performance so that you can focus on the business logic.
