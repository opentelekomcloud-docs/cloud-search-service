Scenarios
=========

CSS can be used to build search boxes for websites and apps to improve user experience. You can also build a log analysis platform with it, facilitating data-driven O&M and business operations. CSS vector search can help you quickly build smart applications, such as AI-based image search, recommendation, and semantic search.

Site Search
-----------

CSS can be used to search for website content by keyword as well as search for and recommend commodities on e-commerce sites.

-  Real-time search: When site content is updated, you can find the updated content in your search within minutes, or even just seconds.
-  Categorized statistics: You can apply search filters to sort products by category.
-  Custom highlight style: You can define how the search results are highlighted.

All-Scenario Log Analysis
-------------------------

Analyze the logs of Elastic Load Balance (ELB), servers, containers, and applications. In CSS, the Kafka message buffer queue is used to balance loads in peak and off-peak hours. Logstash is used for data extract, transform and load (ETL). Elasticsearch retrieves and analyzes data. The analysis results are visualized by Kibana and presented to you.

-  High cost-effectiveness: CSS separates cold and hot storage, and decouples computing and storage resources, achieving high performance and reducing costs by over 30%.
-  Ease of use: Perform queries in a GUI editor. Easily create reports using drag-and-drop components.
-  Powerful processing capability: CSS can import hundreds of terabytes of data per day, and can process petabytes of data.

Database Query Acceleration
---------------------------

CSS can be used to accelerate database queries. E-commerce and logistics companies have to respond to a huge number of concurrent order queries within a short period of time. Relational databases, although having good transaction atomicity, are weak in transaction processing, and can rely on CSS to enhance OLTP and OLAP capabilities.

-  High performance: Retrieve data from hundreds of millions of records within milliseconds. Text, time, numeric, and spatial data types are supported.
-  High scalability: CSS can be scaled to have over 200 data nodes and over 1000 columns.
-  Zero service interruption: The rolling restart and dual-copy mechanisms can avoid service interruption in case of specifications change or configuration update.

Vector Search
-------------

When you search for unstructured data, such as images, videos, and corpuses, the nearest neighbors or approximate nearest neighbors are searched based on feature vectors. This has the following advantages:

-  Efficient and reliable: The vector search engine provides optimal search performance and distributed DR capabilities.
-  Abundant indexes: Multiple indexing algorithms and similarity measurement methods are available and can meet diverse needs.
-  Easy learning: CSS is fully compatible with the open-source Elasticsearch ecosystem.
