Deleting a Cluster
==================

You can delete clusters that you no longer need.

.. note::

   -  If you delete a cluster, the cluster service data will be cleared. Exercise caution when performing this operation.
   -  The snapshots of a cluster stored in OBS are not deleted with the cluster. You can restore a deleted cluster using its snapshots stored in the OBS bucket.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the CSS management console.
#. In the navigation tree on the left, select a cluster type. The cluster list page is displayed.
#. Locate the target cluster and click **More** > **Delete** in the **Operation** column.
#. In the displayed dialog box, enter the name of the cluster to be deleted and click **OK**.
